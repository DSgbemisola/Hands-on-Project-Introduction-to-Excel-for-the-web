- With the Excel 2003 version, we have only 65,000 rows and 255 columns.
- From Excel 2007 onwards (2010, 2016, etc) we have exactly 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns per worksheet.
- Excel columns are labeled alphabetically, starting from "A", then "B", and so on. After "Z", the labeling continues with "AA", "AB", ..., "AZ", "BA", and so forth.
- The sequence continues until "XFD", which is the 16384th column in an Excel worksheet.
